I was preparing to release an open-source version of this file, without the password-protected formulas 
earlier versions of it had. Then I saw user @beechfuzz, apparently an entitled little infant, obnoxiously 
decided to give people directions on how to crack it, against my direct wishes, making sure to post them 
right here in my repo, where he could be sure I'd see it. 

And, he did it immediately after I'd offered to further volunteer my time for free explaining how it 
worked to anyone with questions.

This dick move made me angry enough to no longer feel like sharing my work with the community.  So, you can thank 
"beechfuzz" for this project no longer being shared. 

See https://github.com/ApopheniaPays/excel-liquidity-pool-simulator/issues/2 to watch the drama unfold.

Sorry it had to go this way, but this thing took weeks of work and research to develop, and I'm under no 
obligation to share my work, so if people are going to be go out of their way to piss me off for doing so, 
then it's just as easy for me not to share it at all.
