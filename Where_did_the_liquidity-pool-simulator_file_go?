I was preparing to release an open-source version of this file, without the password-protected formulas 
earlier versions of it had. Then I saw user "beechfuzz" came to my repo to try to give people directions 
on how to crack it against my wishes. This made me angry and I no longer felt like sharing my hard work
with the community. 

So, you can thank them for it no longer being available at all.
