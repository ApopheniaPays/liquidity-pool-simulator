I was preparing to release an open-source version of this file, without the password-protected formulas 
earlier versions of it had. Then I saw user "beechfuzz", apparently an entitled little infant, obnoxiously 
decided to come to my repo to give people directions on how to crack it, against my terms, where I'd be 
sure to see it. This dick move made me angry enough to no longer feel like sharing my work with the community. 

So, you can thank "beechfuzz" for the simulator no longer being available. 

See https://github.com/ApopheniaPays/excel-liquidity-pool-simulator/issues/2 to watch the drama unfold.

Sorry it had to go this way, but this thing took weeks of work and research to develop, and I'm under no 
obligation to share my work, so if people are going to be intentionally piss me off for doing so, then 
it's just as easy for me not to share it at all.
